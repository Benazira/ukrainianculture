                    Pysanky are beautifully decorated Ukrainian Easter eggs, a significant part of Ukrainian cultural heritage. The art of pysanka involves using a wax-resist method to create intricate designs on eggshells. 
                    The word "pysanka" comes from the Ukrainian verb *pysaty*, meaning "to write," because the designs are "written" onto the eggs rather than painted. Each design has deep symbolic meaning, often representing themes like fertility, protection, and the renewal of life. 
                    Traditional motifs include geometric patterns, flowers, and animals, with colors like red, black, yellow, and white, each carrying specific cultural significance. Pysanky are often made during Lent as part of preparations for Easter, and they are believed to bring good luck and ward off evil spirits. 
                    The process is time-consuming and requires patience and skill, making pysanky not just a craft but a cherished tradition passed down through generations.
